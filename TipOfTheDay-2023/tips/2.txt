Topic: grep

The 'grep' command is used to search for a specific pattern 
in a file. To search for the word "apple" in a file called 
'fruits.txt', you can use the following command:

$ grep "apple" fruits.txt

This will display all the lines in the file that contain the 
word "apple". To search for a pattern in multiple files, you 
can use the wildcard character '*'. For example:

$ grep "apple" *.txt

This will search for the word "apple" in all files with the 
'.txt' extension in the current directory.
