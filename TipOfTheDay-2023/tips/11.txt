Topic: sort

'sort' allows you to sort the lines of a text file or input 
stream alphabetically or numerically. It is useful for 
organizing and analyzing data that is not already sorted. 
For example:

$ sort file.txt

This will sort the lines of the file 'file.txt' in 
alphabetical order and print the sorted lines to the 
terminal. The -n option can be used to sort numerically:

$ sort -n file.txt

This will sort the lines of the file 'file.txt' in numerical 
order. The '-r' option can be used to sort in reverse order:

$ sort -r file.txt

This will sort the lines of the file 'file.txt' in reverse 
order.
