Topic: curl

'curl' is used to transfer data to and from a server using 
various protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and more. It can be 
used to download files, upload files, and test APIs. For 
example:

$ curl https://www.example.com/file.txt -o file.txt

This will download the file 'file.txt' from the URL 
'https://www.example.com/file.txt' and save it in the current 
directory with the same filename. The '-o' option specifies 
the output filename.
