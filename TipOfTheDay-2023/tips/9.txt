Topic: head

'head' allows you to view the beginning of a text file or 
input stream. It is useful for previewing the contents of 
large files or output streams. For example:

$ head file.txt

This will display the first 10 lines of the file file.txt. 
You can change the number of lines displayed by specifying 
the -n option, like so:

$ head -n 20 file.txt

This will display the first 20 lines of the file file.txt.
