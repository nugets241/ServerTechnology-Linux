Topic: find

'find' is used to search for files and directories in a 
specified location based on different criteria such as name, 
size, and modification time. It can be used to locate files, 
perform batch operations, and automate tasks. For example:

$ find /home/user/docs -name "*.txt"

This will search for all files with a ".txt" extension in 
the directory "/home/user/docs" and its subdirectories. 
The '-name' option specifies the search pattern.
