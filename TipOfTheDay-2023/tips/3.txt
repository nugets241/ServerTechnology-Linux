Topic: chmod

Use 'chmod' to change the permissions of a file or directory. 
The three-digit code represents owner, group, and everyone 
else's permissions.

To set owner to 'rwx', group to 'r-x', and everyone else to 
'r--', use:

$ chmod 750 myfile.txt

To recursively change the permissions of a directory and its 
contents, use '-R' option:

$ chmod -R 750 mydir
