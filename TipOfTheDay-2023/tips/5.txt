Topic: awk

'awk' allows you to manipulate and process structured data 
files. It can be used to search for patterns, filter, 
transform and manipulate text, and perform calculations on 
data. It works by reading input data line by line and 
separating it into fields, which can be accessed and 
processed individually. For example:

$ awk '{print $1}' file.txt

This will print the first field of each line in the file 
'file.txt'. The '$1' specifies the first field, and the 
'print' command outputs the specified field for each line.
