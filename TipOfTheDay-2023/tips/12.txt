Topic: nl

'nl' allows you to add line numbers to a text file or input 
stream. It is useful for referencing specific lines in a 
document or for preparing files for printing. For example:

$ nl file.txt

This will add line numbers to the file 'file.txt' and print 
the numbered lines to the terminal. The '-b' option can be 
used to specify where to number the lines. For example, 
'-b a' will number all lines, '-b t' will number non-blank 
lines, and -b p will number only lines that contain text:

$ nl -b a file.txt

This will number all lines of the file 'file.txt'. The '-n' 
option can be used to specify the starting line number:

$ nl -n 10 file.txt

This will number the lines of the file 'file.txt' starting 
at line number 10.
