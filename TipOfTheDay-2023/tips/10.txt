Topic: uniq

'uniq' allows you to remove duplicate lines from a text file 
or input stream. It is useful for processing and analyzing 
data that contains repetitive entries. For example:

$ uniq file.txt

This will remove any consecutive duplicate lines from the 
file 'file.txt' and print the unique lines to the terminal. 
The '-c' option can be used to display the number of 
occurrences of each unique line:

$ uniq -c file.txt

This will display the unique lines from the file 'file.txt' 
along with the number of times each line occurs.
