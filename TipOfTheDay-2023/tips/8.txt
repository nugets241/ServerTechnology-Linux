Topic: cut

'cut' allows you to extract specific columns or fields from 
a text file or input stream. It is useful for processing 
structured data files and can be combined with other 
commands to perform complex operations. For example:

$ cut -f 1,3 file.txt

This will extract the first and third fields (columns) from 
the file 'file.txt' and print them to the terminal. The '-f' 
option specifies the fields to extract.
